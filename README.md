# SJTwo

Open source development board for the LPC4078 microcontroller with buttons,
leds, sensors and display, used for educational purposes

## Source Files

I've made the DipTrace source files available so that you can download them,
inspect them, modify them, do whatever you want with them. They can be found in
the `diptrace/` directory. The root of the directory has the current Rev F
version of the board. All older versions can be found in the `diptrace/archives`
folder.

There is also a Segger JTAG Mini to SJTwo adapter in there as well, if you don't
want to connect header pins.

Also included are the `archives` datasheets, 3D models for the Diptrace 3D
renderer, old BOMs and the old gerbers.

Logos, images, datasheets, drawings and 3D models are owned by their respective
owners.

Forgive me for DipTrace as the files cannot be exported or converted to any
other platform, thus locking people into that ecosystem. I'd recommend EasyEDA
as an a free alternative. Fantastic web application that gets better everyday.
And if have the cash to pay for Altium, I'd recommend that.
